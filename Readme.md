## Intro to Python for Data Science Course

The goal of this course is to provide a brief introduction to python with the goal of doing basic data science in pandas.  The course is divided into 5 sessions and will utilize Jupyter Notebooks.  Practice is crucial to learning programming and we have therefore included worked and unworked homework for each lesson.  For best results only look at the worked homework after you have spent a significant amount of time attempting the problem sets. Here are the lessons:

[Intro to Python 1](python_class_01.ipynb)
*[Unworked Homework](intro_to_python01_homework.ipynb)
*[Worked Homework](intro_to_python01_worked.ipynb)

[Intro to Python 2](intro_to_python_cont.ipynb)
*Homework still to be posted

[Intro to Numpy](intro_to_numpy.ipynb)
*[Unworked Homework](intro_numpy_homework.ipynb)
*[Worked Homework](intro_numpy_homework_worked.ipynb)

Still to come:
Intro to pandas
Intro to pandas 2
